I am a data scientist who loves solving real problems with clean thinking, careful analysis, and practical machine learning. Over the last decade, I have worked at the intersection of artificial intelligence, human behaviour, and data-driven decision support. My career has taken me through research labs, universities, and large-scale industry environments, where I have learned how to turn complex questions into clear, measurable, and reliable solutions.

Today, I work as a **Senior Data Scientist at Direct Line Group** where I design, build, and productionise machine learning systems that support pricing & underwriting and operational decision making. I enjoy creating models that people can understand and trust, and I have a particular interest in model transparency, monitoring, and safety in deployment. I believe that good data science is not only accurate but also responsible and explainable.

Before moving into industry, I completed my **PhD in Computer Science and Engineering** at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon. My research explored human–machine interaction, intelligent games, and affective computing. During these years, I designed and ran behavioural studies, built interactive systems, and published work at international venues and conferences. I later expanded my research journey through projects in robotics, social agents, and uncertainty modelling for the automotive sector.

Teaching has also been a meaningful part of my path. I spent time as a lecturer at the **University of Hull**, guiding postgraduate students through data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning fundamentals. Helping learners overcome their first challenges with data has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career.

Across all roles, one theme has remained steady: I enjoy bringing clarity to complexity. Whether I am improving predictive pipelines, building monitoring tools, analysing large datasets, or mentoring junior colleagues, I aim to make data science grounded, transparent, and useful.

Outside of work, I am happiest when I am learning something new, designing small creative projects, or exploring the world around me. I love nature and keep a small garden that I look after with care. Spending time outdoors, hiking, and travelling helps me reset and stay inspired. I also enjoy reading books and poetry, which give me space to reflect and think more deeply. These experiences remind me why I enjoy working with problems that connect back to the real world. Curiosity has been the driver of every step in my career, and I hope it will continue to lead me toward interesting problems and meaningful collaborations.

I also remain deeply connected to research. Even though I work full time in industry and do not currently have the space to pursue my own academic projects, I continue to contribute by reviewing papers and supporting the research community. Volunteering as a reviewer allows me to stay close to new ideas and help others push their work forward.

If you would like to connect or discuss opportunities, feel free to reach out. I always enjoy meeting people who care about thoughtful, responsible, and impactful use of data.
