## Welcome

I am a Senior Data Scientist focused on building reliable, transparent, and practical machine learning solutions for real business problems. I work end-to-end, from understanding the question and data, to building models, to deployment and monitoring in production.

Currently, I work at **Direct Line Group**, where I help design and deliver machine learning systems that support pricing & underwriting and operational decision making.

  Working with interpretability methods and monitoring tools to detect drift, diagnose issues, and keep models reliable over time.

- **Experimentation and analysis**  
  Using data analysis, A/B testing, and careful statistical thinking to answer business questions and evaluate impact.

- **Human-centred AI and research**  
  Background in human-computer interaction, intelligent games, and social agents, with experience in publishing and reviewing academic work.

## Background

My path started with a strong foundation in computer engineering and artificial intelligence, followed by a PhD that combined AI with human behaviour and interaction. Since then, I have moved between research and industry, always with the same aim: to build systems that are technically sound, understandable, and useful.

I enjoy bringing clarity to complex problems, whether that is through a well-designed model, a clear visualisation, or a precise explanation for non-technical stakeholders.

## Beyond work

Outside of work, I enjoy nature and look after a small garden. Hiking and travelling help me reset and keep perspective. I also stay connected to the research community by volunteering as a reviewer, which allows me to support others and keep in touch with new ideas.
