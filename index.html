  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Senior Data Scientist focused on building reliable, transparent and practical machine learning solutions for real business problems. 
    I work end-to-end, from understanding the question and data, to building models, to deployment and monitoring in production.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I work at <strong>Direct Line Group</strong>, where I help design and deliver machine learning systems that support pricing & underwriting and operational decision making.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    My path started with a strong foundation in computer engineering and artificial intelligence, followed by a PhD that combined AI with human behaviour and interaction. 
    Since then, I have moved between research and industry, always with the same aim: to build systems that are technically sound, understandable and useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy bringing clarity to complex problems, whether that is through a well-designed model, a clear visualisation or a precise explanation for non-technical stakeholders.

  <h2>Beyond work</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy nature and look after a small garden. Hiking and travelling help me reset and keep perspective. 
    I also stay connected to the research community by volunteering as a reviewer, which allows me to support others and keep in touch with new ideas.
